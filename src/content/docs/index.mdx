## About This Book

This book is about GPU programming in general, with a specific focus on Triton. I've been using this framework for quite some time, but when I was first learning it for my work, I didn't find any good consolidated resources. That's why I decided to write down my learnings and everything I've come to understand about it.

I don't consider myself an expert in GPU programming or Triton. However, I hope this book can help you onboard, learn, and serve as a consolidated resource that I wish existed when I started.
